"""
Problem: Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (LeetCode #124)
Difficulty: Hard
Category: Trees

Description:
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge. A path does not need to pass through the root. Return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Examples:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: Path is 2 -> 1 -> 3
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: Path is 15 -> 20 -> 7

Constraints:
- The number of nodes is in range [1, 3*10^4]
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

Time Complexity Target: O(n)
Space Complexity Target: O(h)
