Problem: Number of Islands (LeetCode #200)
Difficulty: Medium
Category: Graphs

Description:
Given an m x n 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.

Examples:
Input: grid = [['1','1','0'],['1','1','0'],['0','0','1']]
Output: 2

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 300
- grid[i][j] is '0' or '1'

Time Complexity Target: O(m*n)
Space Complexity Target: O(m*n)
